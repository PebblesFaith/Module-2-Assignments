/* 
2.	The ‘<link href = “test1.css” rel = “stylesheet” />’ element is fetched and executed; after, the DOM construction is fully or partially loaded your test1.html webpage into the browser. And, the ‘CSS’ tree structure  known as, ‘CSS Object Model’ (CSSOM) is similar to the DOM construction for which, the CSSOM is executed after, DOM construction ‘link’ element is fetched and executed.

    •	The CSS tree structure is as follows:
        CSS Bytes => Characters => Tokens => Nodes => CSSOM.

            a.	If async is not present and defer is present:
            The script is executed when the page has finished parsing.

            b.	If async is present:
            The script is executed an asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing.)

    •	Always remember, the DOM construction continues, as soon as the ‘CSS’ file returns with some content then the CSSOM construction begins.
